# buss-mall

 Busmall is a website where users can vote on products that they find appealing and those results are stored in a local storage database which the BusMall company can use to determine what items they would like to sell in their catalog.

 * The voting system is currently set to a limit of 25 votes, but that can be easily changed in the app.js file by changing  `maxClicks` .
 * The votes work because of a click handler event which allows the user to interact with the webpag by clicking on the pictures. The pictures are comprised of randomized sets of three from the lsit of products the devleoper has put into the code.
 * The results can be seen at the bottom in a chart depicting the votes and views of each product. There is also a list which contains text describing the results as well.
